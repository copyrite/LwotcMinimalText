## Action points
* Don't mention action point cost on primary weapon active abilities, unless they're modified by the ability (e.g. Cyclic Fire, Snap Shot)
* Use "Does not end turn" or "Ends turn" with 1 action abilities.
  * No turn end is implied with free actions, and end turn is implied with 2 action abilities.

## Ammo points
* "Requires N ammo to activate" if it does not necessarily consume all. e.g. Multi-shot abilities.
* "Consumes N ammo" if it actually does consume it.

## Ammo items
* If the ability does not benefit from equipped ammo, mention it.

## Buffs
* Buffs are by default not stackable. Mention stacks if applicable.
  * Call them "Stacks of {% PERK %}" if it makes it roll better

## Charges
* For consistency, prefer "charges" over "ammo" when addressing sawed-off -- ammo is for primaries
* "Shares charges with..." if there is a common charge pool between abilities(?)

## Concealment
* Hostile actions breaks concealment by default.
  * Otherwise, "Does not break concealment." or "Breaks concealment, but not Shadow"
* Friendly actions do not break concealment by default.
  * Otherwise, "Reveals you".
* "Cannot be used when concealed".

## Cooldown
* Just use {% COOLDOWN %}, which eventually expands to something sensible
* "Shares cooldown with..." if it shares the cooldown with... yeah.

## Crits
* "Cannot crit" is different from "Does not upgrade hit results".

## Debuffs

## Distance
* "{% ABILITY_RADIUS_TILES %} tile radius".

## Effects
* If the effect has a scales in magnitude with something, "+{% VALUE %} per every {% THING %}".

## Impairments
* Stun durations are measured in actions.

## Line of Sight
* Squadsight range means Line of Sight + anyone in the squad sees the target.
* "Seen by the squad" is the same as Squadsight range with no Line of Sight requirement

## Weapon tiers
* "Bonus/damage/effect improves with {% BOUND_WEAPON_NAME %} tier."
